Sometimes Sales forecasting can be tough when you look too deep in our reports at each different cycle of Sales forecasting with our current analysis tool we are still trying to get right! but we need to improve across all, we can definitely get our lead pipeline pumping properly, especially when i think about how better data management makes both these steps much more robust.

Plus when the marketing teams want something new created I assist also, and finally all these complex elements I receive and work through are often developed within the Engineering teams but also my own department, as for HR, my job here is rather defined with set standards from those so nothing further really here to elaborate.\n",

If you are not seen you’re nothing these days! Although Paid Advertising has its place, its not as effective in all of the channels of engagement so that is limited, but where we are focusing on growing from word of mouth - which for us comes via Referrals.
