Still, like so many jobs nowadays, I actually have a broad set of duties and get into helping people from Sales who want new things from my part. Plus when the marketing teams want something new created I assist also, and finally all these complex elements I receive and work through are often developed within the Engineering teams but also my own department, as for HR, my job here is rather defined with set standards from those so nothing further really here to elaborate.\n",

From a client interaction aspect I also consider Email Marketing super important in our process and also really aids our SEO (Search Engine Optimization) campaigns. If you are not seen you’re nothing these days! Although Paid Advertising has its place, its not as effective in all of the channels of engagement so that is limited, but where we are focusing on growing from word of mouth - which for us comes via Referrals. So for that, a portion falls into that category that fits in the big bucket that sits under the word ‘Other’ which will take too long to get into right now.\"\n",
