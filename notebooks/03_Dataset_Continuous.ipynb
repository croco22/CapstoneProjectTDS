Both of those really caught my attention!\\\" Let me tell you, it\\u2019s kind of been the perfect storm, what with this terrible Lack of time and having the awful experience of App performance issues quite often, not to mention there is other exciting events that came up so they caused me to take my foot off the peddle using this particular app, I would chalk this one up as Other. Lately, I've been really drawn to the technical side of things, I'd say, and there's a few key areas that have been holding my attention; foremost would be Automotive radar target simulation, then there is also a real demand for Noise figure measurements for a variety of projects and I'm keen to investigate that more closely. Beyond those there is the world of Double-Pulse Testing, which is complex, but always satisfying, and obviously any new tech stuff means Display port debugging and compliance has become more relevant and therefore an interesting place for me to concentrate on as well.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"timestamp\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2024-12-25 14:03:47.880000\",\n        \"max\": \"2025-01-23 19:50:33.880000\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 41,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2025-01-11 16:17:03.880000\",\n          \"2025-01-12 19:58:15.880000\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
