So, you're wondering about when the project will wrap up and the deliverables will be available? Hmmm, my gut says we’re probably looking at having all of that in our hands in around a fortnight or thereabouts. Well, you know, the field that I'm involved in is definitely medical, it's fascinating actually\n",

Well, you know, looking back at the last quarter it's tough to pinpoint just one thing because honestly, it's always a combination of factors, right? But if I had to choose, I think we really need to address the sluggish progress we've seen in Product Development, plus we should really double down on enhancing our Marketing Efficiency, because getting the word out matters. I can't help but think that shoring up Data Security across the board should definitely be part of any strategy going forward, too.\n",

Okay, so, for the follow up emails, I think it’s absolutely vital we don't miss anyone! Let's include Stephan Maier, Erik Schneider, Oliver Eibel, Angelina Haug, Johannes Wagner, Jessica Hanke, and Sean Kennin, then we can all make sure we're on the same page, that sounds right?\n",

Right now, if I’m being completely upfront, I’d characterize my feelings about the proposal as Somewhat confident, potential risks are definitely something on my radar, there's still the real possibility of issues, and that keeps me up a bit! Of course we will mitigate as many of the challenges as possible. We still have to be a little cautious since the chance for things to become Not confident, significant risks remains for certain phases so we need to be ready for all types of possibilities and I still hold onto a good measure of faith to move with Moderate confidence and manage those minor risks where they crop up too. I believe there's so much more room to work to get that extra confidence in this project though!\n",
